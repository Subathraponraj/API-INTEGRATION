*DESCRIPTION*: I have developed a webpage that fetches and displays weather data from a public API OpenWeatherMap.It have generated an API key and using which the weather information have been fetched.Using html,a header tag containing the heading ,a main tag containing the input fields, buttons, and display areas for weather data and a footer tag which shows the last update time have been created.The main section contains a text input field for entering a city name, a voice search button that enables users to search for a city using voice commands, and a button for fetching weather based on the user's current location using the Geolocation API. Additionally, it displays current weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief weather description. The weather icon dynamically updates based on the current weather condition, and the background image changes according to the weather type (e.g., a sunny background for clear weather, a cloudy background for overcast skies, and a rainy background for wet conditions).

Using css,an appealing layout and a smooth user experience have been created.It utilizes flexbox to align elements properly and maintain responsiveness across different screen sizes.The main container has a semi-transparent black overlay to enhance readability, and buttons have hover effects to improve user interaction. The weather forecast boxes are designed to be scrollable for hourly and weekly forecasts, which ensures that a large amount of data is displayed neatly without cluttering the interface.Additionally, the application maintains a modern and visually engaging design with its use of dynamic background images that change based on the weather conditions, making the experience more immersive for users.

The JavaScript file drives the functionality of the application by integrating the OpenWeatherMap API. When a user enters a city name and clicks the "Get Weather" button, the application makes an API request to fetch weather data for that city. Alternatively, if the "Use My Location" button is clicked, the Geolocation API retrieves the user's latitude and longitude, which are then used to fetch the weather data. The application makes two API callsâ€”one for the current weather data and another for the forecast data. The current weather section displays essential details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions, while the hourly and weekly forecast sections provide future weather predictions in a structured manner. The hourly forecast shows updates in three-hour intervals for the next 24 hours, and the weekly forecast extracts data for the next seven days.Thus, the platforms I have used are Visual Studio Code,OpenWeatherMap.

A key feature of this application is its voice search functionality, powered by the Web Speech API. This allows users to simply speak the name of a city, and the app will automatically fetch and display its weather data. This feature makes the application more accessible, especially for users who may find typing inconvenient.The application also includes screen reader support, making it accessible for visually impaired users. Planned improvements include a dark mode toggle for better usability in low-light environments. Overall, this showcases the integration of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs, and accessibility features to build an interactive and visually appealing weather application.
